<enter 3 numbers per line, the first number corresponds to the number of the first node, the second number corresponds to the number of the second node 
and the third corresponds to the weight of their connecting edge>
<for example 1 2 1 would mean, add the node with number 1 and the node with number 2 and add an edge with weight 1 that connects these 2 nodes>
<if at least 1 of the nodes already exists then only the non existent node with be added along with the edge or if both nodes already exist 
only the connecting edge will be added>
